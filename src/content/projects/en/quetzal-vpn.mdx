<Section class="text-body-lg mt-12" markdown={{list: true}} name="More Details">
  I developed **QuetzalVPN** in a team of 4 as a school project at <a href="https://www.sz-ybbs.ac.at" target="_blank">IT-HTL Ybbs</a>.
  My main focus was the **frontend** and **UI / UX** design.

  The project is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/QuetzalVPN/quetzal-vpn" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
  
  <a href="https://github.com/RaZoD1" target="_blank">Raphael</a> was my main **collaborator**. He wrote the backend in **Kotlin**
  using the **Ktor** framework while also being reponsible for server configuration and communication.

  I did my design in **Figma** and implemented it with **React** and **TailwindCSS** for the styling.
